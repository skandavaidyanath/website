I am a Member of Technical Staff at [Yutori](https://yutori.com/). We're building multi-modal web agents.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of reinforcement learning (RL) and natural lanuage processing (NLP). Through my research, I hope to gain a better understanding of _how_ machines learn and try to make them learn tasks in the same way humans do. My long-term goal would be to develop machines that understand and approach learning tasks in the same way that a human would and can generalize to a variety of settings.

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about technical interests we might share, feel free to get in touch!
