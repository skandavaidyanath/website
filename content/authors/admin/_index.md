I am a Staff Research Scientist at Riot Games AI Accelerator. I conduct AI research for gaming applications and work on reinforcement learning and large language models.

Before I joined Riot, I graduated from Stanford University with a master's in computer science (AI track).

My research interests lie primarily in the area of reinforcement learning (RL) and control. Through my research, I hope to gain a better understanding of _how_ machines learn and try to make them learn tasks in the same way humans do. My long-term goal would be to develop machines that understand and approach learning tasks in the same way that a human would and can generalize to a variety of settings. 

I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Dileep George, Prof. Dorsa Sadigh, Prof. Stefano Ermon, Dr. Sriram Rajamani, and several other outstanding advisors in the past.

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about technical interests we might share, feel free to get in touch!
